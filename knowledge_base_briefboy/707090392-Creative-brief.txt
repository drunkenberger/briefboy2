    THE CREATIVE BRIEF
    Creative Briefing is the tool to unleashing the creative forces of the art
    director/copywriter team.

    It must inform, but more importantly it must inspire them.

    Usaually a 1 page document.

    It outlines the approach and scope of a creative project, serving as a map that
    guides creative teams through the specifications and requirements for a project
    or campaign from start to finish.

    Creative briefs are essential for ensuring that creative assets are on-brand and
    in line with the campaign’s objectives.

    Without one, much time & effort could be wasted retracing steps and recreating
    assets that were off the mark.

     REQUEST
     BRIEFLY, WHAT THE CLIENT
     IS ASKING US?

     It is a CONCISE DESCRIPTION of the request formulated (more or less explicitly) by the
     client in its Client Brief. It’s the starting point for the strategic thinking.

     Sometimes – above all when the brief is difficult - the request is NOT SO CLEAR or it’s
     clear only in few sections but the problem that the client asks to solve is not the right one
     or – again - it’s clear but it is unfeasible in terms of timing or costs.

     So, let’s say that this section is useful because it defines the MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
     for the strategic, creative and accounting solution to be considered “in brief”, but it does
     not exhaust the scope of work of the project.

     It’s crucial that the whole team (account/planner/creatives) CLARIFIES, IF NEEDED, THE
     CLIENT BRIEF from the beginning of the process and then be aligned on the further steps.

     TARGET
     WHO IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS
     OF YOUR ADVERTISING?
     This section describes THE PERSON YOU WOULD LIKE CREATIVES TO HAVE IN MIND
     when they explore and evaluate their ideas. And he/she is the person you are talking to,
     someone interested in your proposition.

     It could be SOMEONE YOU KNOW, or you could create an IMAGINARY CHARACTER.

     Usually they are the Buyers/Users of a Brand (end-consumers), but they could also be
     other people such as Investors, Key Opinion Formers, Journalists, etc ...

     The description should go BEYOND THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION.

     It should specify who they are, how they behave, which are the “motivation” behind a
     specific behaviour, what they likes & hates, how these people spend their time, and also
     define the role they play towards the Brand/Product you’re selling.

13
     COMPETITION
     WHO IS FIGHTING FOR YOUR TARGET
     MARKET’S ATTENTION IN THIS AREA?

     It describes the context in which the briefed product/brand is competing. So that you can
     create advertising that is different from the competition – if any – and/or identify the
     opportunity area.

     Typically this description explores the CATEGORY DRIVERS, highlights the POINTS OF
     PARITY & DIFFERENCE of the product (i.e. the elements that are necessary for the
     brand/product/service in question to be considered competitive), and a synthesis of the
     different COMMUNICATION TERRITORY and MESSAGES delivered by the competitors.

     The description must not be limited to describe only the category in which the product
     belongs (NARROW CATEGORY), but must also broaden the reference area to the need
     served, thus also including more different product categories (ENLARGED CATEGORY). In
     this regard, it may be useful to ask yourself who or what the brand/product/service has
     to fight against.

     PROBLEM
     WHICH IS THE PROBLEM THAT
     THE ADVERTISING MUST SOLVE?


     It describes the PROBLEM that advertising must solve. It’s crucial! It defines the directions
     of rest of the brief.

     It should NOT REFER TO THE BUSINESS PROBLEM (e.g. defending a price increase, loss
     of market share) or MARKETING PROBLEM (e.g. low purchase frequency, low market
     penetration). That is probably written in the client’s request. The problem written in the
     Creative Brief should refer to the SPECIFIC PROBLEM THAT ADVERTISING SHOULD
     SOLVE (see examples).

     The statement of the ‘problem’ is ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY THE OBJECTIVE. So it’s clear
     what the challenge is, what must the advertising achieve. The objective should not be
     neither too general, providing insufficient direction, nor too narrow, allowing for little
     creative freedom.

     INSIGHT


     Definitions abound about what an insight actually is:

     – An unrecognized fundamental human truth.
     – A new way of viewing the world that causes us to re-examine existing conventions and
     challenge the status quo.
     – A penetrating observation about human behavior that results in seeing consumers from a
     fresh perspective.
     – A discovery about the underlying motivations that drive people’s actions.

     An insight is penetrating hidden truth, that unlocks creativity. The insight finds a link
     between the consumer, the brand and the problem that must be solved, to produce great
     and effective work.



24
     FINDING THE RIGHT INSIGHT CAN DRIVE YOU




        CRAZY
 Strategist and creatives frequently struggle to arrive at the definition of a
proper insight and they repeat the process again and again for finding and
                   articulating it in the best possible way.
