VISUAL   IMMERSIVE   COLLABORATIVE
Disruption ® is central to our business and our being.
 
At the heart of the methodology is defining growth strategies for our clients. Strategies that
are single-minded and daring enough to inspire disruptive ideas and behaviors every day. 
 
We come to a strategy of Disruption ® by deciding what has to change (Convention) and
defining where we want to go (Vision). 

In this section we will explain the three fundamental exercises for both Convention and
Vision.  

We will also explain the purpose of these exercises and the Disruption ® platform.

CONVENTION HUNTING
We call it Convention Hunting because we are hunting for opportunities to challenge the status quo in a
way that will unlock the market for the brand in our care. Nothing gives a client more of an appetite for a
new visionary approach than working out for themselves how conventional their industry is. And seeing
where it can be challenged.




WHAT IS A CONVENTION?
It is an underlying assumption that governs choices or judgement, a habit of thinking or behavior usually
so familiar that nobody questions it.

Most sectors have developed marketing and communication habits; they tend to follow informal rules,
everybody doing more or less the same thing in the same sort of way. Convention hunting is about
observing what these things are and then looking for an explanation.

SUMMARY OF OUTPUTS
1. A perspective on the whole marketplace and how it works; the players, their strategies, their assumptions and
   habits, and how consumers react and respond to their behaviour
2. An understanding of what doesn’t work so well in the current system and why not
3. An understanding of where, how and when the category is important to the audience and the potential our
   brand has for different / better relationships
4. Insight into what is really core to the brand and what can be changed as we focus on disrupting the
   marketplace in its favour.


We are now ready to plunge into the future to see how visionary this brand can be.

EDGES:
WHAT ARE THEY?

    There are three main types of edges, each of which should be printed on its own color for this exercise:




                       GREAT                       TRENDS THAT POINT                 REAL EXAMPLES

By printing edges and physically mapping them out with their edges touching each area of connection, a potential
future strategy can be shaped for a brand.  
 
This will guide a company to be future-bold rather than oblivious to what’s coming. An example of a mapping of
edges is on the next slide.
