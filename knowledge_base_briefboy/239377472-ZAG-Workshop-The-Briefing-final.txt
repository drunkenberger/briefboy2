YOU CAN'T BE A LEADER BY FOLLOWING A LEADER.
YOU CAN ONLY BECOME A LEADER BY CONVERTING 
WHITE SPACE INTO A MARKET POSITION.
FACT:
POSITIONING differentiates a brand 
in a customer’s mind to obtain 
strategic competitive advantage.
Positioning creates the pecking order 
that determines profit margins. 
Pecking order is crucial because categories arrange 
themselves by doubles and halves.
If Brand 1 represents a certain percent of 
market share, Brand 2 will represent half.
