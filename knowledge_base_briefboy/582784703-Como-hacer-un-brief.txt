    Task                                                                        Success Criteria

     E.g., new product launch, reposition the brand, generate inquiries          How will this activity be measured and are these measurements in place?



    Why is this brief here?
    What‚Äôs keeping the client awake at night? What‚Äôs happening in the client‚Äôs business that has prompted the need for
    communication? What is the big brilliant problem we can help to solve?

    Who are we trying to influence?
    Who is it we need to influence and how (if at all) do they currently think, feel and behave towards the brand/category/
    product area? Ask yourself what they are currently doing that we need to change. Think about any barriers that exist.
    Please bring these people to life in a way that will help the creative team get inside their heads, not just as general
    consumers but within the context of the specific challenge the brand faces. NB: The relevant points will set the scene;
    more in-depth info can be attached in the Inspiration section or saved for the briefing.


    What do we want them to DO as a result of this communication?
    When it says ‚Äúdo‚Äù it means DO. This is the actual change in behavior that will ultimately affect the client‚Äôs business‚Äî
    and help them sleep well at night. A simplistic answer like ‚Äúbuy more X‚Äù is not enough‚Äîeveryone in the business is
    doing that. Be specific rather than general. You‚Äôll need to have explored who you need to influence, what they are
    currently doing, and how we need to change it before you can express this fully.

    How do we expect communications to work towards achieving this?
    How are the communications actually going to DO that? Will they shock, engage, make things more relevant, entice
    people to trial, create a unified voice for the brand, change the way people feel about when and where they should
    consume the product and so get them to consume it more often? How will our communications reward people for
    the time they spend with them?

    What are we trying to convey?
    What is the core thought that will drive the creative solution? Think about whether this should be a big ideaL‚Ñ¢,
    a killer fact, a promise, a straight message, or just a plain and simple big idea‚Äîit depends on the task at hand.


    What will help people to KNOW this?                                         What will help people to FEEL this?
    What makes this competitive, relevant to the target and                     What are the core values or personality of the brand we need
    true? NB: Additional product detail can be attached as                      to stay true to? Are we questioning or directing? Are we
    an addendum to the core brief.                                              being inclusive or exclusive? Are we talking conspiratorially
                                                                                with people or are we distant and authoritative? What do
                                                                                we imagine the tone of the communication to be?


    Mandatories                                           Channels                                            Supporting Materials
    What are the immutable ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù                   Where and when will we reach people                 List any additional technical specs,
    or ‚Äúmust nots‚Äù for this task? E.g., avoid             in the most receptive state of mind?                copy briefs, or product details
    attacking competition or using slapstick              (Please expand as needed.)                          supporting this brief.
    humor, ensure culturally sensitive
    references, feature the product, etc.

Foreword
By Tham Khai Meng, Worldwide Creative Director
    Pervasive Creativity. It‚Äôs what Ogilvy aims for. We want to be the network that
    does the best, the freshest and the hottest creative work in the world.

    That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm delighted by this renewed focus on the very start of the creative
    process‚Äîthe creative brief.

    Everyone who writes a creative brief has the opportunity to make a difference.
    You remember the old computer acronym GIGO? ‚ÄúGarbage In, Garbage Out.‚Äù
    It‚Äôs like that with briefs.

    Every creative team has horror stories of receiving lousy briefs. Dull, vague,
    confusing, thoughtless briefs. What chance do they have of producing sparkling,
    fresh creative work if the account team doesn‚Äôt brief them properly?

    But every creative team also remembers those briefs that made a difference. Briefs that
    ignited their imaginations. Briefs that opened up new possibilities. Briefs that inspired
    and enthused.

    That‚Äôs what Pervasive Creativity means here. Writing a brief has to be a creative act
    in itself. That will give creative teams their best chance of producing great work.
    The better the brief, the better the work.

    Our Twin Peaks strategy‚Äîthe strategy of producing the most creative work in
    the world as well as the most effective‚Äîstarts here. With great briefs.

    The DO Brief TM form is here to help you. It asks the tough questions you need
    to answer in order to write great briefs. Please study and apply the lessons in
    this short book.

    Thank you, and good luck.

Introduction
By Tim Broadbent, Global Effectiveness Director
    WHY IS THIS GUIDE HERE?

    President John F. Kennedy wanted to sell the idea of landing a man on the Moon.
    He said, ‚ÄúWe choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things,
    not because they are easy, but because they are hard.‚Äù

    The DO Brief is hard. Most creative briefs ask familiar questions. The DO Brief
    asks tough new questions. This guide explains why. It will help you answer those
    questions better.


    WHAT‚ÄôS NEW ABOUT THE DO BRIEF?

    1. It begins with a question about the client‚Äôs business issue.
       Not an awareness issue, or an image issue, or a positioning issue, but a business issue.
       Unless our creative work helps drive the client‚Äôs business, it will pass like a ship
       in the night. All clients want profitable growth. How can we help?

       To help solve the client‚Äôs business issue, we need a commercial idea‚Äîan idea
       that uses Ogilvy‚Äôs creativity to address their business issue.

    2. It asks what communications must get consumers to do.
       How must consumer behavior change‚Äînot just awareness or perceptions, but
       behavior? For instance, a charity ad might raise your awareness. It might even
       move you to tears. But unless you put your hand in your pocket to donate money,
       it failed.

    3. It asks how communications will change behavior.
       All campaigns exist to get somebody to do something, but they work in different
       ways. Some persuade, giving rational information about a product benefit.
       Others make the brand famous. Still others strengthen emotional engagement.
       There are many other possibilities. We need to be clear about which communications
       model applies in this situation.

    4. It asks what we need to convey.
       Unlike most creative briefing forms, it does not assume the solution is always
       to drive a logical, factual proposition into consumers‚Äô minds. Often the most
       effective campaigns create an emotional impression of the brand. Conveying
       information can be effective, but conveying feelings can be more effective.

    5. It is channel-neutral and global.
       Previously, Ogilvy & Mather Advertising, OgilvyOne, Ogilvy Public Relations
       Worldwide and OgilvyAction each had different briefing forms. The DO Brief
       encourages integration among strategists of all disciplines because it is the shared
       platform for all activity. It is also used in all regions. All of us must use the same
       tools in this globalized world.




8
WHY DOES IT ASK THESE QUESTIONS?

1. To improve briefing quality.
   Filling in the DO Brief ought to make your brain hurt. It demands clarity, focus
   and consistency as well as creative stimulation. The harder you work at the briefing
   form, the better the briefing will be.

2. To help clients buy original work.
   It is easier for our marketing clients to sell seen-it-before creative work within
   their own companies. Helping them buy fresh, truly original work is part of the
   planner‚Äôs job, perhaps the most important part. Stanley Pollitt, one of the fathers
   of account planning, said something crucial about the planner‚Äôs role that seems
   to have been forgotten: ‚ÄúThe rationale of creative work after it has been developed
   will become much more important than the initial creative brief.‚Äù

   What is a ‚Äúrationale of creative work‚Äù? It is a narrative that explains how the work
   will sell more. It involves four steps:
     i) Review the brand‚Äôs sales and position in the market to identify
        a business opportunity.
    ii) Identify the key consumer segment for that opportunity.
   iii) Analyze consumer behavior and attitudes in terms of the defined
        business opportunity.
   iv) Articulate the role of communications in bringing about the desired
        behavioral change.
   These reflect the first four questions on the DO Brief. Answer them properly
   and you are well on the way to selling the work as strategically right.

3. To judge creative work.
   Creative work should be judged against strategy. Unless you happen to be
   in the target market, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you personally like, say, the look
   of the lead actor or the music track. The question is whether the work will get
   the sales job done.

   If you and the client agree on the communications strategy‚Äîby going through
   the Ogilvy FusionTM process and the DO Brief together‚Äîit will be easier to
   judge whether the work will be effective with its target audience.




                                                                                          9
     WHERE DOES IT FIT INTO OGILVY FUSION?

     Ogilvy Fusion is Ogilvy‚Äôs new operating system. Its purpose is to provide a way
     for our disciplines to work more closely together and produce deeply integrated
     360 Degree campaigns.

     There are two versions: Ogilvy Fusion (designed to be completed in 48 hours
     or a similarly short time) and Ogilvy FusionProTM (designed for longer and more
     complex marketing programs). They share the same five-stage process:




     There are three Ogilvy Fusion stages before the DO Brief.

     Business Ambition is first. This asks the essential questions to help articulate the
     client‚Äôs business issue or opportunity. It then helps define the marketing and
     communications goals.

     Customer Experience identifies barriers and drivers to purchase at each step of
     the consumer journey. It also covers the desired consumer response to our
     communications at each step.

     Architecture identifies the roles for communications and basic channel choices
     at each step.




10
The Solution inspired by the DO Brief is the fourth stage. It follows as
a natural progression from the previous Ogilvy Fusion stages. In essence,
Ogilvy Fusion is a statement of our strategy, and the DO Brief is the one-page
summary and creative inspiration‚Äîit is where the rubber meets the road.

You may need sub-briefs for particular communications tasks or channels in
very elaborate, complex campaigns. Use the DO Brief format for these too.

The fifth stage is Effectiveness, which identifies key success metrics based on
the Business Ambition we started with.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Colin Mitchell and John Shaw wrote key sections. Paul Matheson,
Gavin Macdonald, and Catherine Moustou of Ogilvy Asia Pacific made
many helpful comments and supplied examples; they were also key members
of the team that devised, tested and trained the DO Brief in the first place.
The Inspiration section came from Sarah Newman‚Äôs tenure as Head of Planning
in Ogilvy London. Many thanks to them.

If you are lucky, Ogilvy RED Consulting or Business Acceleration will have done
some upstream analysis that will answer this question for you. But most often it‚Äôll
be up to you and your team to find an answer.

Some account teams will say at this point, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know about sales; the client
doesn‚Äôt share that information with us.‚Äù But have you asked? Perhaps if you ask
politely and explain how important it is, the marketing director would spend a half
hour briefing the team on the business challenges facing the brand.

You can find out a lot by yourself. For instance, what do financial journalists and
industry bloggers say about the client‚Äôs business? What‚Äôs in that industry‚Äôs trade
magazines? What do the company‚Äôs own financial reports and press statements
say? Does your managing director or finance director know? Do you know someone
who works in that industry? It‚Äôs always better to make an educated guess about
the client‚Äôs business issue than to say nothing, because then clients can correct any
misapprehensions
   Why is this brief here?when they review the brief.
       What‚Äôs keeping the client awake at night? What‚Äôs happening in the client‚Äôs business that has prompted the need for
       communication? What is the big brilliant problem we can help to solve?
It is essential that you try to find out what the business issue is. Campaigns that are
based on business or behavioral objectives are more than four times as likely to be sales
                                                                      1
effective as campaigns based on attitude or awareness objectives. Ogilvy Fusion‚Äôs
Business Ambition section suggests the key questions for you to answer.

Others might say, ‚ÄúCreatives don‚Äôt need to know this.‚Äù But they do, and they‚Äôve asked
for it before. Ogilvy‚Äôs most senior creatives asked us not to shield them from business
realities in briefings.


       Who are we trying to influence?
       Who is it we need to influence and how (if at all) do they currently think, feel and behave towards the brand/category/
       product area? Ask yourself what they are currently doing that we need to change. Think about any barriers that exist.
       Please bring these people to life in a way that will help the creative team get inside their heads, not just as general
       consumers but within the context of the specific challenge the brand faces. NB: The relevant points will set the scene;
       more in-depth info can be attached in the Inspiration section or saved for the briefing.




The perfect answer to this question would include:
   i) a quantitative description of the target audience, including their buying behavior
      in relation to the business issue identified in the preceding section, and
    )
  ii a qualitative description that brings them alive as people to creatives.
      Here‚Äôs a great example from an Axe brief:

       How do we expect communications to work towards achieving this?
       How are the communications actually going to DO that? Will they shock, engage, make things more relevant, entice

The brief asks for a communications model for the ad. What is a ‚Äúcommunications
model‚Äù? There are three kinds:

1. Models of communications in general

    It used to be thought that all communications work the same way. Some clients
    and researchers still think that. Typical ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù models include:

         AIDA: Attention, interest, desire, action.
         STARCH: See, read, remember, act upon.
         DAGMAR: Awareness, comprehension, conviction, action.
         AIETA: Awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, adoption.

    These communications models are old‚Äîfor instance, AIDA dates from the 1880s.
    They assume a) consumers are passive and empty-headed, and b) communications
    move consumers through a linear sequence of conscious, discrete mental events
    before they buy anything. Neither of these assumptions is credible today.

    Communications models like these fundamentally misunderstand the way our
    minds, and campaigns, actually work. They don‚Äôt reflect learnings in neuroscience,
    psychology or in-market effectiveness. So why do they still survive? Because they‚Äôre
    plausible, not because they‚Äôre right. They‚Äôre convenient checklists for pretest
    research and tracking studies.

    But this can create a big problem for us. Creative ideas may appear to fail in research.
    In reality, the problem may not be the creative idea but the communications model
    that underlies the research methodology. However, rebriefing the creatives because
    of an imaginary problem wastes money and diminishes creative morale. You may
    need a conversation with the client and research agency about how this particular
    campaign should be pretested and tracked.

2. Models of some campaigns

    A more sophisticated approach allows that different campaigns may work in
    different ways. Three of the most widely used sets of communications models are:

       Hall & Partners:
         Sales Response‚ÄîPeople register a buying opportunity that fits their plans.
         Persuasion‚ÄîPeople take out a piece of information.
         Involvement‚ÄîPeople get involved in the advertising.
         Salience‚ÄîPeople register the ad as standing out in its sector.2

Campaigns,‚Äù Admap, March 1992



                                                                                                          17
            Millward Brown:
              Immediate Challenge‚ÄîPeople take away ‚Äúnew news‚Äù about the product
              that creates an immediate desire to buy it.
              Interest/Status‚ÄîPeople‚Äôs memories of advertisements make them more
              likely to buy brand X.
              Enhancement‚ÄîMemories of advertising claims and images are converted
              during experience of the product into beliefs about the brand.3

            IPA:
              Emotional Involvement‚ÄîPeople feel greater empathy for the brand because
              of the emotions created by the ad, or its likability.
              Fame‚ÄîPeople talk more about the brand and its advertising, see it as making
              waves in its category.
              Information‚ÄîPeople take away a piece of information about the brand,
              its users or their world.
              Persuasion‚ÄîPeople are convinced by rational argument that brand X
              is superior.
              Reinforcement‚ÄîPeople are reminded to keep on doing what they already
              do (loyalty campaigns).4

         There are effectiveness results only for this last set. Emotive strategies (Fame and
         Emotional Involvement) are more likely to be sales effective than rational strategies
         (Persuasion and Information). Reinforcement campaigns are the least effective:

                                                                Effectiveness success rate
                                                                           %
                     Fame                                                  72
                     Emotional Involvement                                 68
                     Persuasion                                            61
                     Information                                           61
                     Reinforcement                                         33


         You need to work out in advance which of these communications models is most
         likely to bring about the behavioral change described in the previous section of
         the brief. This will be based on your understanding of the consumer and the kind
         of behavioral change you are looking for. Even though emotive campaigns have
         a higher success rate in general, persuasive or informative campaigns might be
         better in a particular case.

     3. Model of this particular campaign

         Rather than using a standard, off-the-shelf influence model, think through the links
         between the campaign and the purchase. Ogilvy Fusion will help you here, with the
         Ogilvy Communications BlueprintTM exercises.

    To give an example of thinking through the purchase process, a brand of fruit juice
    was bought by mothers and drunk by kids.5 Research showed kids were unlikely to
    ask for any particular brand in this sector. An important role for the campaign was
    to get mothers to believe their kids would love it even though they didn‚Äôt actively ask for it.
    This communications model is clear in this diagram:

    Example of bespoke communications model




    The DO Brief version of this might say something like, ‚ÄúWe need moms to believe
    this is not only high-quality juice, but also will be a treat for their kids. The trouble
    is that kids don‚Äôt ever ask for it by name. How can we get moms to believe it is
    popular with their kids if they never ask for it? By making a campaign their kids
    love. The campaign‚Äôs popularity with kids will lead mothers to believe that the
    brand is popular with them too.‚Äù

    With a communications model clearly in mind, it is much easier to design pretest
    and tracking research appropriate to this particular campaign.

     In most briefs this section would be called ‚ÄúSupport for the Proposition,‚Äù which tends
     to lead towards rational, fact-based claims. But we now know information is only one
     flavor of effective campaigns, and usually not the most effective. So the DO Brief gives
     knowledge and feelings equal status.

     If you want to convey factual information, you would give more emphasis to the
     Knowledge box. If you want to convey a feeling, you would write more in the Feelings
     box. You don‚Äôt have to fill both boxes each time.

     Be very selective about what you write in either box. Avoid clich√©s and platitudes.
     Does what you have written really support the ‚ÄúConvey,‚Äù and is it meaningful,
     appropriate and imaginative? Or is it there for other reasons‚Äîfor instance, to appease
     the client or account team? Then the brief will confuse the creatives.

Finally, we come to the practical stuff that creatives need to know before they actually
begin working on something.

 Mandatories restrict creative freedom, so, as the brief says, only include the
‚Äúimmutables.‚Äù That includes the things that will get the ad rejected out of hand
 as unbuyable. Creatives must be informed of these ‚Äúmust nots‚Äù immediately,
 before they start work, or you may waste their time on routes that will never see
 the light of day.

The Channels box will summarize the Ogilvy Communications Blueprint from
Ogilvy Fusion.

For briefs with many detailed requirements‚Äîoften direct, digital or retail activation
briefs‚Äîattach a separate page to the DO Brief.

The brief MUST be signed by the account, planning and creative directors before
it enters the creative department. Creatives are absolutely right to refuse to work
on DO Briefs without all three signatures.

The remaining boxes are self-explanatory.

        Brief must be logical,

The E.g.,
    success       criteria must fit the task. The target
          new product launch, reposition the brand, generate inquiries
                                                                          audience must fit the business issue.
                                                                       How will this activity be measured and are these measurements in place?
The desired change in behavior must fit the influence model. And so on with the
other sections.

Always remember David Ogilvy‚Äôs advice: ‚ÄúWhat most clients want from us is great
campaigns, with the spark to ignite sales and the staying power to build enduring
brands.‚Äù Read through your brief one last time critically before you pass it to the
creatives. Has it got that spark? Has it got staying power?

       Hibiki Rebranding                   Business Target: Annual Sales 6.5 billion JYP   7 billion JYP (+8% in 5 years)


      Why is this brief here?
      The whisky category and Hibiki are suffering. Young people aren‚Äôt drinking it. Its formal and hierarchical drinking occasions
      are disappearing. And for all but the very loyal, there‚Äôs little emotional engagement and certainly very little pleasure
      associated with it. And even though it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs best blended whisky, very few people understand the superiority
      of the blend over one-note pungent malts. More broadly speaking, this applies to the world of premium alcohol overall.
      As the leading brand in the Suntory whisky portfolio, Hibiki needs to change this.
      We need to bring Hibiki back to life; it needs to live in the modern world. We need to position it as contemporary,
      with something unique and compelling to say and engage with.
      Who are we trying to influence?
      Male, 35 ‚Äì 40, premium whisky drinkers (including Hibiki), plus drinkers of other premium alcohols.
      He‚Äôs a man who‚Äôs hungry for experiences and looks to get the most from life and what it has to offer. He lives life dynamically
      and appreciates drama, complexity, rarity, and newness. He searches for inspiration in today‚Äôs age, he‚Äôs focused on
      what‚Äôs of the highest quality, and he always wants something authentic. He loves to go to the best places, not for show
      and status but because interesting things happen in them. Mixing with other people is at the top of his agenda because
      it‚Äôs about meeting exciting new people and encountering new worlds.
      He drinks what he considers to be the best and most interesting alcohol. He needs to understand that Hibiki is by far
      the best and most interesting choice he could make.

      What do we want them to DO as a result of this communication?
      To actively choose Hibiki and to understand why they‚Äôve done so. To do so versus other premium whisky choices,
      and to do so at times when other premium alcohols may also be considered.

      How do we expect communications to work towards achieving this?
      We will talk about blended whisky (and our superior blend) in a new way, a way that is rich, evocative and emotionally
      compelling in the story it tells about Hibiki (and by association the Hibiki drinker).
      For current Hibiki drinkers, this will reinforce why they already choose Hibiki. For those drinking other premium alcohols,
      it will make it very difficult not to try Hibiki.

      What are we trying to convey?
      Hibiki: Make Life More Complex.

      What will help people to KNOW this?                                      What will help people to FEEL this?
      A master blend of carefully selected malt and grain                      ‚ÄúMake Life More Complex‚Äù is not just about whisky‚Äî
      whiskies, matured for a minimum of 17 years.                             it represents a bigger ideal. When we look at life,
                                                                               we realize that people who lead lives with varied
      Bringing many different characters together to make one
                                                                               experiences achieve so much more than anyone else.
      very deep ONE is what makes us special.
                                                                               ‚ÄúMake Life More Complex‚Äù should remind our target of this.
      This process is where the drama happens: bring different
                                                                               Intimate, beautiful, charismatic, inspiring, premium.
      characters together and something new will be born.

      Only Hibiki understands that when we bring different
      people, things and experiences together, something
      dramatic happens, as our name Hibiki (resonating) implies.

     Why is this brief here?
     Dove‚Äôs hair scientists have spent years developing a world-class, patented, superior hair repair technology. It is being launched as
     a new range of shampoos and conditioners called Dove Damage Therapy. It‚Äôs a brilliant solution to a problem the vast majority
     of women don‚Äôt think they have. Creating the need is difficult because no woman wants someone pointing a finger at her and
     calling her ‚Äúdamaged.‚Äù It‚Äôs insulting. Why would she listen?
     The point of this brief is to turn the issue of damage on its head, making damaged hair something women actively choose to confront,
     rather than something they deny or shy away from.

     Who are we trying to influence?
     Women who don‚Äôt think of their hair as damaged. They would probably describe their hair as pretty normal: sometimes it behaves
     itself and other times it‚Äôs dry, or has split ends, or is a mass of frizz that‚Äôs a nightmare to style. But that‚Äôs normal; it doesn‚Äôt mean their
     hair is damaged and it doesn‚Äôt mean they need a special, therapeutic repair system. When they hear ‚Äúdamaged hair,‚Äù they think of
     extremely frazzled hair that has been colored, cooked, crimped and coiffed to a crisp‚Äîcertainly not their own. That‚Äôs why they shun
     existing damage/repair variants.

     What do we want them to DO as a result of this communication?
     We want them to positively embrace the notion of damaged hair. When people ask them their hair type, they should reply ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù
     ‚Äîconfidently and with a twinkle in their eye. They should place their Dove Damage Therapy bottles in plain view in their bathrooms as
     badges of honor and hope that guests notice them. They should use Damage Therapy every time they feel like their hair could use a
     little TLC (e.g., the morning after a big night out; at the end of a hard week; after the beach; after working out; any time their hair feels
     dull and lifeless). They should join online communities and forums with handles like Stressed Tresses and leave supportive messages
     for other women with damaged hair. They should put bumper stickers on their bashed-up cars that say things like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just my hair
     that needs repairing.‚Äù

     How do we expect communications to work towards achieving this?
     Communications will democratize damaged hair by revelling in the fact that it‚Äôs a simple fact of life for 80% of women. They will not
     work by lecturing or hectoring, which is the category norm. Nor will they attempt to induce anxiety. Instead, communications will be
     upbeat and celebratory: hair damage is part of being a woman, part of the Dove sisterhood.

     What are we trying to convey?
     DAMAGED HAIR: BRING IT ON! Because damaging your hair is a sign that you are living life to the fullest.

     What will help people to KNOW this?                                            What will help people to FEEL this?
     Damaging your hair is normal. There‚Äôs nothing to be fearful                    Pantene‚Äôs solution would be to prey on women‚Äôs insecurities
     or concerned about. Everyone does it. Blow-drying, brushing,                   with fear-based communications that go deep inside the hair shaft
     coloring and straightening all damage hair. Just living life                   to reveal the damage that blow-drying and straightening cause.
     damages hair.                                                                  But Dove isn‚Äôt Pantene. Dove is positive and supportive of women,
                                                                                    not undermining.
     Dove Damage Therapy makes light work of the repair.
     It‚Äôs a patented technology that beats Pantene and salon                        Dove is about ordinary women getting on with it, embracing their
     brands in laboratory tests. It delivers tangible benefits:                     imperfections with grace and humor.

   As did Michelangelo and countless other

     WHAT MAKES THEM GOOD BRIEFS

     1. They‚Äôre creatively stimulating. They‚Äôre also clear and internally consistent (no false
        trails), and they make sense.

     2. They‚Äôre rooted in real client business issues:
      ∆¢…†¬Ñ¬â¬ê¬ï¬Ñ¬ç¬é¬Ä¬ì¬å¬Ñ¬ï¬ä¬î¬ä¬è¬É¬Ñ¬Ç¬ç¬ä¬è¬Ñ¬ä¬è¬ï¬â¬Ñ¬ì¬Ñ¬Ç¬Ñ¬î¬î¬ä¬ê¬è∆ë¬â¬Ä¬è¬à¬ì¬ä∆É¬Ä¬è¬Ñ¬Ñ¬É¬îƒéƒç¬é¬ê¬ì¬Ñ¬î¬ï¬Ä¬ö¬î
          per night per hotel just to keep revenues the same as last year.
             ‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs lovely about ‚Äú10 more stays‚Äù is that it makes advertising‚Äôs task vivid
              and real for the creatives. A similar calculation was made famous in a recent
              Sainsbury‚Äôs IPA Effectiveness paper.6 Sainsbury‚Äôs commercial objective was to
              increase sales by ¬£2.5 billion over three years. This amount was too vast to be
              a useful input into the creative process. A simple sum showed it actually meant
              customers spending ¬£1.14 more per visit (¬£1.14 x 14 million customers x 52
              weeks x 3 years = ¬£2.5 billion).
             ‚ÄìThis calculation ‚Äútransformed the role for communications: to getting shoppers
              to spend a little extra,‚Äù which ‚Äúunlocked the ¬£2.5 billion problem so that
              creativity could be used to solve it. An unimaginably daunting objective was
              transformed into something as tangible and approachable as it‚Äôs possible to
              imagine.‚Äù Can you translate big corporate objectives into tangible consumer
              behavioral changes like this on your briefs? Can you solve huge problems with
              solutions based on the behavior of individuals? Creatives will love you for it.

     INSPIRATION


         Ogilvy & Mather Core Creative Brief: New Idea Generation‚ÄîInspiration
         Use this page for anything that you think could give creative people inspiration in
         solving the brief, visual as well as verbal.

         For example: links to relevant material on the web, books, articles, movie references,
         music, art, TV, celebrities, a ‚Äúrant‚Äù you have written, thought starters, pieces of
         advertising, any material which f leshes out the target audience, or anything else
         that could help.


     The first page of the DO Brief ensures relevance to the client‚Äôs business. The second
     page is optional. Its role is to stimulate fresh executions.

     Creative people usually ask for two things from a brief: direction and inspiration.
     They are likely to want direction as they start work on a project, but as they try to
     solve it they may be looking for inspiration.

     The requirements for direction and inspiration are different. Direction needs to
     be clear and logical. It must be followed. On the other hand, inspiration can be
     intuitive, touchy-feely and visual. It does not all need to be followed; it can be
     used or discarded according to whether it is helpful.

     What you put in the Inspiration section is very much up to you. It is your chance
     to think of the most exciting and interesting examples and stimuli that bring the
     central thoughts of the brief to life. It‚Äôs also an opportunity to make your brief
     stand out in relation to the other briefs that are floating around the creative
     ¬É¬Ñ¬ë¬Ä¬ì¬ï¬é¬Ñ¬è¬ï∆ê¬ï¬ê¬à¬Ñ¬ï¬ö¬ê¬ñ¬ì¬Å¬ì¬ä¬Ñ¬Ö¬ï¬ê¬î¬â¬ê¬ñ¬ï¬ê¬ñ¬ï∆Ü¬ê¬ì¬å¬ê¬è¬é¬Ñ∆ó∆ç

     The Inspiration section should look like an enticing chocolate box of stimulation.
     Choosing a few good pieces of stimuli you believe in is more valuable than a huge
     quantity of stuff. You might use songs, paintings, video, movies, websites, and
     other pieces of communication, or your own thoughts. You could even make the
     Inspiration section a couple of visual slides where the links open automatically.
     (Yes, PowerPoint can be used creatively.)

     1. Ford Fiesta

       Part of the Inspiration section compared the relaunch of the Ford Fiesta with
       Tarantino‚Äôs rescue of John Travolta‚Äôs career and the launch of the iconic iMac.
       The eventual work‚Äîpart of what was described by the senior Ford of Europe
       client as ‚Äúour most successful launch ever‚Äù‚Äîhad something of the confident mood
       of the iMac launch. It was not encumbered with product messages about the
       Fiesta, but gave the brand a sense of being a desirable, fashionable icon:

              John Travolta




            John Travolta
            The success of Saturday Night Fever in the 1970s typecast John Travolta as a Disco Stud. The sequel, Staying Alive
            was a commercial disaster and he went on a string of other weak rom-com flops for which the critics severely beat
            him up. Disenchanted, he more or less disappeared until his career was resurrected playing the part of Vincent Vega
            in Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs Pulp Fiction in 1994. Pulp Fiction, like predecessor Reservoir Dogs, is regarded as one of
            the most influential Hollywood films of its era‚Äîa new category-defining phenomenon littered with pop-cultural
            references. Many scenes and lines from the film have achieved iconic status. Whilst Travolta thanked Tarantino for
            relaunching his career, Tarantino commented that ‚Äúthe public hadn‚Äôt stopped loving you John, they just needed a
            reason to fall back in love with you.‚Äù


              iMac
            On arrival at Apple, Steve Jobs rejuvenated Apple‚Äôs image with the immensely successful Think Different campaign.
            He cancelled the majority of the R&D projects: one of the few which survived the cull was the iMac which
            relaunched and rejuvenated the company (one of the other projects was the iPod).
            Its unusual shape, colours and materials gave it an iconic status both in the design and technology worlds...
            In 1998, the iMac launched, where Apple famously declared that ‚Äúthe back of our computers look better than the
            front of anyone else‚Äôs.‚Äù http://www/youtube.com/results?search_query=apple+mac+colors

   The team that developed Fanta‚Äôs ‚ÄúStealth Sound System‚Äù was able to create
   a stimulus that brought the spirit of Fanta to life, and referred specifically to
   the technology that formed the basis of the highly awarded campaign:

       This Inspiration section illuminated some of the most resonant themes for its
       target audience (a more leading-edge group than Fiesta‚Äôs): discovery, eclecticism
       and playful subversion. The successful multichannel campaign clearly reflected
       these themes:

                    Is a street artist who pastes up characters from and is inspired by the
                    Space Invaders game. He does this in carefully selected locations, in
                    cities across the world, then documents it as an invasion, with maps of
                    where to find each invader.
                    His philosophy is that of ‚Äòleaving a gift to the city‚Äô. His art is rarely
                    removed, because it‚Äôs visible to the right people yet under the radar of
                    the wrong people.

24-HOUR BRIEFS

Sometimes first thoughts are right. We might spend weeks working on a pitch
strategy only to lose sight of the obvious. There‚Äôs a small window of opportunity
during which we still think like consumers. We might say it lasts for the first 24 hours
after receiving a new brief. Use that time of clarity to write a creative brief. Use the
DO Brief format‚Äîit‚Äôs only six questions.

The 24-hour Brief is provisional. It gives a working hypothesis of the strategy before
we do the work necessary to complete a full DO Brief. Management consultants,
who use this practice widely, call it ‚Äúsolving the case before solving the case.‚Äù

It is particularly useful when creative work has to be produced quickly, but it also
has other advantages. The discipline of writing one forces you to form a hypothesis,
which makes subsequent primary and secondary research more purposeful. It aligns
the team before they all go off in different directions. It allows the whole team,
particularly creatives, to start mulling over the problem immediately. Otherwise
creatives have to wait until the rest of the team has completed its work before they
can even begin thinking about solving the problem.

The best way to write a 24-hour Brief is to assemble a ‚Äúswarm‚Äù meeting immediately
after the client briefing and brainstorm the problem. You can also invite experts
in the agency who might help. The swarm arrives at a best-guess consensus and
someone writes it up and distributes it within 24 hours. The priority is to get a clear
articulation of the client‚Äôs business problem. That‚Äôs what the creatives need most
before starting work.

Sometimes your first impressions will be very near the mark. However, often
the strategy will evolve considerably as the pitch develops. The 24-hour Brief is
no substitute for a fully thought-out DO Brief. No matter how perceptive first
impressions are, they can always be improved upon. Always reserve the right to
go back to the creatives later with a revised brief if you learn more from research,
thinking or analysis.

THE ACTUAL BRIEFING

Probably the worst thing to do is write a brief, slip it under the creatives‚Äô door and
run away. You are missing an opportunity to influence the work.

Jeremy Bullmore, the former creative director of JWT London, explained how
briefings lead to ideas.7 Ask a writer of fiction to write a story and he may not know
how to begin. Ask him to write a story about, say, an international terrorist and
a tube of toothpaste, and he‚Äôll soon get started.

Creatives in agencies may sometimes yearn for greater freedom, for release from
the tyranny of the brief. But it is precisely this tyranny that provides stimulus for
invention. David Ogilvy may have seen many black eye-patches, but it was not
until his mind was preoccupied with the problem of selling Hathaway Shirts
that he realized black eye-patches were the solution to his problem.

However, the act of briefing requires a different kind of thinking from writing
the brief. The brief comes at the end of the strategic process. Writing it involves
logical, deductive thought based on information. The briefing comes at the start
of the creative process. Its purpose is to spark ideas, to encourage lateral leaps
and invention.

Get to know the creative team before briefing them. What makes them tick as
people? What creative work do they admire? What are their proudest achievements?
What do they consider to be their best work? How do they like to be briefed‚Äîdo they
prefer briefs to be plain and simple, or do they prefer to improve on creative starters?
Do they want mountains of information or just one word?8

Briefings must motivate and inspire the creatives. Talk about communications ideas,
not about marketing strategy. Be more enthusiastic about the creative possibilities
than the business possibilities. Make the briefing fun, but keep it relevant.

Use the briefing to start a conversation. The creative process needs fuel. Briefing
is a process, not a one-off action. Stimulate an ongoing dialogue and discussion.

 Consider extending the Inspiration section of the brief to the briefing‚Äôs venue
 and style. Sometimes it can help to turn a key element of the brief into a visceral
 experience‚Äîwhether riding in the back of a BMW at 150 mph, or sitting naked
 in a hot spring, or visiting a room where Picasso painted, or being shown the real
 meaning of teamwork by Marines in an underwater tunnel, or sampling the
‚Äúgreasy spoon‚Äù lifestyle of van drivers, or spending an evening with prostitutes

     CONCLUSION

     The DO Brief and the creative briefing are tools that help us reach the Twin Peaks.
     Ogilvy is a creative business above all, a creative business that helps our clients
     to grow. We measure our success by creative awards and by effectiveness awards,
     but above all by our clients‚Äô success.

      360 Degree campaign to promote pinkish-white skin                         Switching data / consumers trading up



     Why is this brief here?
     Three-quarters of skin-lightening products sold are ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù‚Äîi.e., the cheapest. There are significant millions
     to be made by trading consumers up a step to Pond‚Äôs White Beauty. This is one level below Pond‚Äôs Flawless White.
     The challenge is to convince these price-conscious consumers that Pond‚Äôs is superior to their existing product
     because only we deliver a naturally pinkish-white result.


     Who are we trying to influence?
     I live in a big city. It‚Äôs not the capital, but it‚Äôs growing. You can see me on my scooter, skirting through traffic on my way
     to work. I have a good job, office based, and the people are nice. I spend quite a lot of time on MSN and the mobile.
     I like shopping, dancing, gossiping, flirting. Money is tight, but I‚Äôll spend it if I think something is worth it. Right now
     I use a skin-lightening brand called Dabao. It does not meet my needs, but I buy it out of habit. Good skin is important,
     though, because it is the first thing boys see‚Äîand I want boys to see me.


     What do we want them to DO as a result of this communication?
     Put aside their spare change for the next trip to the skin-lightening aisle.


     How do we expect communications to work towards achieving this?
     Discount skin-lightening products may be inexpensive, but they give cheap results: they simply mask your face with a
     blank, artificial white color. A natural complexion is pinkish-white, glowing from within and full of life. This is about quality,
     not quantity‚Äîwomen must realize that White Beauty is several degrees superior to their current brand because it really
     transforms the color of their skin.


     What are we trying to convey?

     Task                                                                            Success Criteria

      Develop a DRTV spot                                                              Improved response and closure rates

     Why is this brief here?
     The middle market life insurance need is sizable, with an $11 trillion coverage gap‚Äîa $20 billion annual premium opportunity‚Äîand MetLife
     has made it a priority to sell twenty thousand policies via direct channels. Historically, DRTV efforts were less than satisfactory, and following
     the momentum achieved with a quick fix to the current spot and new media plan, Ogilvy will develop entirely new work.

     Who are we trying to influence?
     Middle market consumers are ‚Äúemerging families‚Äù whose heads are typically aged 25 ‚Äì 45, in dual-income households earning $35K ‚Äì $100K.
     They have new responsibilities at this stage in their lives, with many new milestones such as marriage, buying a first home, and the birth
     of a first child. While many women get the ball rolling, men convert at higher rates as they identify themselves as the primary breadwinner.
     Many are worried about the economy and losing their jobs, are burdened with debt and are time pressured. With the recession, many wonder
     how they‚Äôll ever be able to retire and now believe they need to take responsibility for their own future security. They know they ‚Äúshould have‚Äù
     life insurance, but either don‚Äôt feel confident buying it, see it as too expensive for their budgets, or have at some point started the process but
     have given up after finding it too complex. If they do plan ahead, a 401(k) is more often seen as more desirable. Life insurance is just not sexy.
                I don‚Äôt want to be pressured into something. I‚Äôm pretty sure we can‚Äôt afford it. I‚Äôm not sure we need it. It‚Äôs something
                so far in the future.
     With the recession, trust has eroded across most financial service brands. Consumers see MetLife as trustworthy and identify with Snoopy,
     but still mistrust commissioned sales representatives as using high-pressure sales tactics.

     What do we want them to DO as a result of this communication?
     Call the toll-free phone number and get a free term life insurance quote (visit website for secondary CTA).
     Test alternative: Call the toll-free number‚Äîtoday, getting life insurance is easier than you think (visit website for secondary CTA).

     How do we expect communications to work towards achieving this?
     Address the tension between prospects knowing they ‚Äúshould‚Äù have life insurance and their putting off facing the decision since
     the consequences/benefits are seen as far in the future. Jump-start their action today with a free, no-obligation life insurance quote.
     Reframe life insurance as a ‚Äúfinancial safety net.‚Äù

     What are we trying to convey?
     An online or phone quote from MetLife is one of the easiest and most affordable grown-up things you‚Äôll ever do to protect your family,
     here and now.
              Man up! Then live your life.
